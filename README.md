# Twitch Bot Queue
Twitch Bot that creates a 'queuing' system for people who have follower/sub games.

## Installation
1. Modify the two configuration (`config/config.json`, `config/options.json`) files with the appropriate details.
2. Create a table named `queue` with tables named, `twitch_name` & `epic_name` (currently only support for Epic Games).
3. Perform the command `node run.js`.

## Disclaimer
This is still a WIP project. A lot more has to come.
